        <p>How do you think the universe began?</div></p>
     </div>  

     <div class="question-containerB">    
         <p><div><b>Kim:</b></div></p>
         <p>I believe that the universe started due to the big bang and slowly life forms formed all over the universe since Im not a follower of any religious beliefs for example in christianity they believe that God made the universe which led up to Adam and eve(ps which means a lot of incest happened which I dont want to believe that part). I believe in science I believe that the big bang started it and over centuries science just did its job created stars, planets, etc...</div></p>

        <p>Do you believe in ghosts? Have you ever seen a ghost?</div></p>
     </div>    

     <div class="question-containerB">    
         <p><div><b>Kim:</b></div></p>
         <p>I am a strong believer in ghosts due to many stories and my obvious hate for the dark. Especially in any culture there are multiple stories of ghost but in Korea especially we have stories and ghost figures that everyone knows for example in korea the ghost figure 처녀귀신 chuneogishin is very popular and its about a female who died young without being married so she goes around haunting people for her frustration and sorrow that she died without getting married. I never seen a ghost and to be honest I dont ever want to since that lead me to basically shut myself in my room while always having someone next to me to calm me down.</div></p>

      <div class="question-containerA">
        <p><div><b>Mildrew:</b></div></p>
        <p>Do you often think about what happens after death?</div></p>
     </div>    

     <div class="question-containerB">    
         <p><div><b>Kim:</b></div></p>
         <p>I believe that there is a life after death and though I dont believe in religious concepts heaven I believe in some of concepts such as that whatever actions while did while alive would definitely have an impact in the after life since there is not action that doesnt have any consequences. I believe that we are judged by whatever actions we have made and treated differently based on the way you have lived your life.</div></p>

       <div class="question-containerA">
        <p><div><b>Mildrew:</b></div></p>
        <p>Do you grow up practicing a religion? Do you still follow that religion?</div></p>
     </div>  

     <div class="question-containerB">    
         <p><div><b>Kim:</b></div></p>
         <p>I went to a Christian school during my elementary years so I took a lot of bible study classes, prayers, etc... Weirdly enough I also went to a Catholic preschool so I had a lot of exposure to religion while I was young but due to my family or close friends being atheist or not really involved in religion I slowly got further away from it and being living without religion but I do believe in some of the concepts of religion but not really believer in religion.</div></p>

          <div class="question-containerA">
        <p><div><b>Mildrew:</b></div></p>
        <p>Have you ever prayed? If so, talk me through your process of prayer.</div></p>
     </div>  

     <div class="question-containerB">    
         <p><div><b>Kim:</b></div></p>
         <p>As I said before when I was young I had a lot of exposure to religion so I did pray in school before classes or meals but slowly due to not enough exposure as I got older I slowly started praying less and not believing in religion. Now I dont pray at all unless Im in very bad situation for example please God let me get an A in this course.</div></p>

          <div class="question-containerA">
        <p><div><b>Mildrew:</b></div></p>
        <p>How do you feel about religions and religious ideology other than your own? Have you ever been interested in other religions?</div></p>
     </div>  

     <div class="question-containerB">    
         <p><div><b>Kim:</b></div></p>
         <p>I do believe in religious concepts but as stated before not a devote follower of religion of any kind but I do believe in concepts of God, heaven, judgement, and afterlife. Though Ive seen a lot and heard a lot about many religious concepts to be honest its just not the way I think and to no disrespect anyone but I just find unbelievable to me.</div></p>

          <div class="question-containerA">
        <p><div><b>Mildrew:</b></div></p>
        <p>How important is spirituality/religion important to you in general and on a daily basis and how do you feel about that?</div></p>
     </div>  

     <div class="question-containerB">    
         <p><div><b>Kim:</b></div></p>
         <p>I do not believe in any of those but in way I do in believe spiritually happiness since you have to be happy in order for your body to healthy. I dont really think about it in my daily basis so really I have never thought it about until now.</div></p>

      <div class="question-containerA">
        <p><div><b>Mildrew:</b></div></p>
        <p>How do you feel about dying? Would you say you fear death?</div></p>
     </div>  

     <div class="question-containerB">    
         <p><div><b>Kim:</b></div></p>
         <p>I think that everyone fears death no matter who they are so naturally I also fear it but I believe its a natural process in life. I am never gonna be ready for it but I do believe in the idea.</div></p>

        <p><div><b>Mildrew:</b></div></p>
        <p>What was your first experience with death as a child? Is there a religious association with this memory for you?</div></p>
     </div>  

     <div class="question-containerB">    
         <p><div><b>Kim:</b></div></p>
         <p>My first experience with death is memorial ceremony of my passed relatives. Like in most asian countries we respect our passed family members by offering meals or giving prayers to them at their grave site by giving a traditional bow to them 2 times. Thats the first memory of death to me as a child me.</div></p>
